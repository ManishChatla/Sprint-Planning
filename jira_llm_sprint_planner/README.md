# Jira + LLM Sprint Planner Agent

This tool fetches Jira sprint tickets and uses an LLM (e.g. GPT-4) to assign them to available team members based on skills and capacity.

## ðŸ”§ Setup

1. Set your OpenAI key in `.env`:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key
```

2. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the planner (using mock data):
```
python main.py
```

4. Optional: Modify `jira_connector.py` to fetch and assign tickets live from Jira.

## ðŸ§  Output

The output is a JSON-style assignment plan generated by GPT based on ticket descriptions and member profiles.
